## 🚀 **ResQLink: Crowdsourced Disaster Relief Coordination Platform**

---

## 📖 **Project Description**

**ResQLink** is a modern, real-time **web-based disaster management platform** designed to bridge the gap between **disaster-affected individuals** and **relief responders**. During crises like floods, earthquakes, or fires, timely aid can save lives. ResQLink provides a streamlined system for:

- 🧍‍♂️ Individuals to **report disasters** and request help without logging in.
- 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 **Volunteers** to receive, accept, and act on verified requests.
- 🏥 **NGOs** to manage resource distribution and coordinate efforts.
- 🧑‍💼 **Admins** to verify, dispatch, and monitor requests for action.

Through **geolocation**, **notifications**, and **role-specific dashboards**, ResQLink enables an organized and efficient relief response network during emergencies.
